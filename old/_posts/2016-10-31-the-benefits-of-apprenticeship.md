title: The Benefits of Apprenticeship
date: 2016-10-31

In my last weeks as an apprentice here at 8th Light, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I have gained through the experience. After all, many of my fellow Dev Bootcamp graduates moved right into client work and Junior Developer roles that didn’t require the same amount of additional study and preparation. What did I gain from the experience?

## Technical Skill

As an apprentice, I have worked in Clojure, Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, and Elixir. I’ve gained experience with a variety of different languages that I just wouldn’t get working at a company with a single stack and an existing codebase. I’ve had time to learn new languages, to explore topics that interest me, and to try out a variety of strategies and design patterns. While I still wouldn’t consider myself an expert, I have expanded my skill set as a generalist. 

In my exploration of various languages and programming styles, I have learned not just the ways each language is different, but the ways that the fundamentals of writing clean code are the same in every language. As technology changes and languages come in and out of vogue, I think having this foundation is essential. 

## Test-Driven-Development

Though this probably falls under “Technical Skill”, I think it is important enough to deserve its own heading. 

I know enough other developers to know that finding a workplace that truly values TDD is the exception, rather than the rule. As a matter of fact, as someone who regularly has conversations about unit testing at the dinner table, it’s been interesting to compare experiences. From my dad who wrote software in Fortran and Cobol before the days of automated testing, to my know-it-all brother who “generally writes pretty good Javascript”, to my boyfriend who bothered his coworkers so much about writing unit tests that his company recently added “head of unit testing strategy” to his job title, I know that commitment to test-driven-development is definitely not standard across the board. 

While I will not claim that writing lots of tests automatically makes me a better developer than any of the other people who share their opinions with me on a regular basis, I will say that I am thankful for the opportunity I have had to practice TDD though katas and small projects before applying my skills to a large codebase. I’ve learned that it’s not just the number of tests I write or the amount of test coverage, but the quality of the tests as well. I’ve gained experience writing tests that describe the overall behavior and intent of the code in addition to the small pieces of functionality in every method or function.

## Mentorship

Being an apprentice means that you get a level of one-on-one mentorship that you just don’t get in every job. I have saved this one for last, not only because I think it has been the biggest benefit to me personally, but because I think it’s the most important aspect of apprenticeship. 

I will admit that it’s been hard at times to have made it through four months of freelancing, five months of Dev Bootcamp, two months of job searching, and seven months of apprenticeship, and still feel like I have no idea what I’m doing. When many of my developer friends have settled into a smaller niche where they feel mostly competent, sometimes it’s been hard to maintain growth mindset when there are so many new things to learn every day. 

However, I know that I am a much better developer than I was all those months ago, and it’s mostly due to support, accountability, and code reviews from my mentors. I know that I wouldn’t be where I am today if I were in this alone, and didn’t have people pushing me outside my comfort zone on a daily basis. 

No matter where I end up in the years to come, I consider myself quite fortunate having been through this experience, and I hope to continue the tradition of learning and passing on my knowledge as I continue in my career.
