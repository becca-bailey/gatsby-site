title: Non-Technical Thoughts on Work-Life Balance

Work-life balance can be a tricky thing. While some companies try to create a culture where it is a priority, not all do. In fact, some companies specifically seek out the ones who wear busyness like a badge of honor, the ones who are more than willing to give up their lives for the sake of so-called productivity. I’m grateful to be working for a company that makes this a priority, and talks frequently about what could perhaps be called work-life-client balance.

Even during my short time as an apprentice, I’ve been through different seasons. I’ve been through the season where I feel productive and dedicated and I have no problem putting in extra hours to get my work done and feel satisfied with what I have accomplished. By default, I tend to gravitate more towards work than life, and no, I don’t just say that in job interviews.

More recently, though, I’ve been through the season where it’s harder to put in the extra time. Life has thrown a lot of things at me at once, and I’ve had to think a lot more carefully about where my priorities are, and how I’m going to fit them all into days where I sometimes feel spread too thin. Some things have slipped through the cracks, I’ve made a few apologies, and I’ve had a few days where I feel distracted by personal things at work, and distracted by work things at home.

I’m still figuring this out along the way, but here’s what I’ve learned so far.

1. Breaks are important.

    For me at least, it’s really difficult to stay focused on a single task for hours on end without getting distracted. However, knowing that I have a designated time to take a break seems to help. Even if it means I have to put in a little more time in the morning or the afternoon to accomplish my goals for the week, there are some days when it helps to take a longer break in the middle of the day to return phone calls, to take a walk to clear my head, or to write down a few thoughts in my journal. Some people prefer to take multiple shorter breaks—it’s all a matter of preference.

2. Be honest.

    Though I’m not working on a client project yet, I’m trying to get into the mindset of being transparent about how much time I am putting in to a particular project or feature. Also, for my own sake, I’ve had to learn to communicate clearly, and not bite off more than I can chew. We’re all human, and some weeks will be more productive than others. Honesty and communication are key, especially during busy seasons.

3. Scale back.

    I read a book once that said you should “quit something every Thursday”. Though quitting something every week might be a little extreme, the advice has stuck with me. Over the past couple of months, I’ve scaled back on tech meet ups, side projects, and social events. I’m still involved in a couple of things that are important to me, but I’ve had to be much more selective about the ways I choose to spend my time.

4. Act on your priorities.

    I’ve already mentioned priorities, but I would also like to note that there’s a difference between saying something is a priority and actually taking concrete steps to make it one. Personally, I’ve made a list of relationships, causes, and projects that are most important to me. If there’s a person on my list, I can’t just write them on the list—I need to show them that they’re a priority through my words and actions. If it’s a project or an item on my to-do list, I need to block out time in my schedule to work on it.

When it comes to finding balance, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Things will change as life and work go through different seasons, and that’s okay. I’m still don't get it right every day, but I think I’m moving in the right direction.
