Ever since I started learning to code, I've been interested in the similarity between learning a spoken language and a programming language. For example, [translation from one language to another](/lost-in-translation) doesn't always result in the idiomatic usage of a new language.

I was talking about this with a new friend who is leaving her job as a foreign language teacher to go to Dev Bootcamp. Though there are obvious differences in the way you learn a spoken language and a programming language, we thought it was interesting in both cases there is a difference between just using the language and being fluent.

For example, in middle school French class, my teacher would not allow students to go to the bathroom unless we asked in French. So, we all memorized the sign he had taped to the wall that said *Est-ce que je peux aller aux toilettes?* and we were good to go. As language learners, we usually learn one way to talk about the weather, one way to say how we feel today, one way to ask for directions. And I know from experience that you can get by with these simple phrases for quite a while.

As a fluent English speaker, though, when I think about the way I communicate, I don't always say things in the same way. The terminology I use, the order of the words, the formality of the tone can change on a whim, depending on what I am thinking or feeling in any given moment.

When I first learned to code, I assumed it would be more like middle school French class. JavaScript was my first language, and I remember the early days of learning for-loops and print statements, writing down code snippets and memorizing them so I would have something to work from the next time I encountered a similar problem.

This is a way to start, but one of the most interesting and challenging parts of gaining fluency in a language is learning the subtle differences between between passable code and good code. Passable code will do the job, but good code is readable and easy to change. Good code doesn't always look the same from person to person. Passable code can be written in a day, but good code is learned over many years.

So, every time I have to stop to Google a Clojure function, every time I re-factor some poorly written code, I remind myself that I'm still learning. I'm not fluent yet, and that's okay.
