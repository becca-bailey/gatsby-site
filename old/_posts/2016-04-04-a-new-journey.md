## This week, I am starting a new journey as a Resident Apprentice at 8th Light in Chicago.

I'm pretty sure I got here because of a nagging feeling I had during Dev Bootcampâ€”the feeling that says *there has got to be a better way to do this*. It was annoying at the time, wanting to improve but not quite knowing how. At Dev Bootcamp, efficiency was important, and testing was sometimes (but not always) an afterthought. It was a wonderful experience overall, and I suppose this is to be expected in a program intended to bring its students to a basic level of programming knowledge in only 18 weeks. As one of my favorite Dev Bootcamp instructors once said, the whole experience is somewhat akin to drinking from a fire hose. Without super-human coding abilities, there's only so much you can take in at once.

### But still, this nagging feeling is what lead me to consider an apprenticeship over a traditional junior developer position.

Even during the application process, I appreciated the opportunity to thoughtfully consider my design decisions, and get meaningful feedback on my work as I was completing the code challenge. During Dev Bootcamp, I hastily read through Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby (affectionately known as POODR) by Sandy Metz, but never gained an in-depth understanding of how to implement things like single responsibility classes and duck typing (which, by the way, does not actually involve a duck using a computer). After I received the initial feedback from 8th Light on my coding challenge, I was banging my head on a wall, trying to figure out how to make my code more flexible and easier to test. Lo and behold, Sandy Metz came to my rescue with her infinite wisdom. As I re-read the book, I finally had the chance to stop and implement each principle as I went.

### Though I do not claim to be an expert on *anything*, as I am just starting my second day on the job, this whole process so far has taught me more about Software Craftsmanship, and why its so important.

This week, I've been reading Apprenticeship Patterns by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye.  I'm beginning to read about *Walking the Long Road* as a programmer, and realizing how important it is to consider long-term goals in your life and your work. Instead of focusing on benefits like a bigger paycheck, short-term notoriety, or the bit of pride you gain from making something that is beautiful, but not very useful, craftsmanship is all about delivering the best possible product and improving these skills over the course of a lifetime. This may be a huge topic to cover another time, but it's worth noting that software craftsmen tend to be a more diverse group than what you would find at your average tech startup, as in, software craftsmen are not always white and asian men under 35.

**I'm excited for this journey, and I look forward to sharing what I learn along the way.**
