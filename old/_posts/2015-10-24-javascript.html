<h3>Did you know??</h3>

<pre><code class="javascript">
var n = 1; 
console.log("This is number " + i + ".");
=> This is number 1.
</code></pre>

<p>See what I did there?  I put an integer in a string, and JavaScript automagically did a type conversion.  Let's see what happens when we try to do the same with Ruby.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
n = 1
puts "This is number " + i + "."
=> TypeError: no implicit conversion of Fixnum into String   
</code></pre>

<p>Oops, sorry Ruby, I guess you're not as cool as JavaScript.  Actually, many JavaScript developers have a love/hate relationship with this feature, as it sometimes causes confusion when the developer doesn't mean to automatically change the type.  Allow me to demonstrate.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
function addTwo() {
number = prompt("What is your favorite number?");
console.log(number);
console.log(number + 2);
}  
=> "6"
=> 62
</code></pre>

<p>In case you didn't go to elementary school, there's a problem with this equation.  Have you figured out what it is?</p>

<p>JavaScript tried to be nice, and avoid giving you an error message by doing an automatic type conversion.  However, since you input both a string (the user input) and an integer, it just wasn't sure which one you wanted.  It is just a computer, after all. So, to be accommodating, it automatically converted your integer to a string.  When you add the two strings, "6" + "2" = 62. </p>

<p>Like ruby's <code class="javascript">.to_i</code> method, JavaScript also has a way of dealing with this problem.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
function addTwo(number) {
number = prompt("What is your favorite number?");
console.log(number);
console.log(parseInt(number) + 2);
} 
=> "6"
=> 8
</code></pre>

<p>Ahh, that's better.  By using the <code class="javascript">parseInt()</code> method, JavaScript can convert a string back to an integer, which is especially helpful when dealing with user input.</p>

<p>Well, now you know.</p>
