### This week, I have been working on [the Gilded Rose kata in Clojure](https://github.com/mjansen401/gilded-rose-clojure).

Looking over the code, the first thing I noticed was the serious need for some polymorphism.  If you're new to this, let me explain.

#### Polymorphism allows functions to behave in slightly different ways, depending on the object that it is called on or the parameters that are passed in.

In an object-oriented language like Ruby, this is fairly simple to accomplish. For example, let's say I wanted to write a simple program that prints a greeting.

{% highlight ruby linenos%}
class Person
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class English_speaker < Person
  def say_hello
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name}!"
  end
end

class Spanish_speaker < Person
  def say_hello
    puts "¡Hola, me llamo #{@name}!"
  end
end

john = English_speaker.new("John")
pablo = Spanish_speaker.new("Pablo")

john.say_hello
  # => "Hello, my name is John!"

pablo.say_hello
  # => "¡Hola, me llamo Pablo!"
{% endhighlight %}

Simple, right? Using polymorphism, we don't have to write methods with awkward names like say_hello_in_spanish, nor do we have to remember what language a person speaks when we call the method.

In a functional language like Clojure that doesn't have a clear inheritance structure, this can be a little trickier. One way of accomplishing this is multimethods. For example, here I am able to mimic the same behavior using maps to store data.

Note: `defmulti` requires a *dispatch function* which in this case is a map location.

{% highlight clojure linenos %}
(defmulti say-hello :Language)

(defn english-speaker [name] {:name name :Language :English})

(defn spanish-speaker [name] {:name name :Language :Spanish})

(defmethod say-hello :English [person]
  (println (str "Hello, my name is " (:name person) "!")))

(defmethod say-hello :Spanish [person]
  (println (str "!Hola, me llamo " (:name person) "!")))

(defmethod say-hello :default [person] :wave)

(def john (english-speaker "John"))
(def pablo (spanish-speaker "Pablo"))

(say-hello john)
  ; => "Hello, my name is John!"

(say-hello pablo)
  ; => "¡Hola, me llamo Pablo!"

(say-hello {})
  ; => :wave
 {% endhighlight %}

These functions can mimic the behavior of objects which have attributes, and `defmethod` will create a method that can only be called on functions with certain attributes. For example, you can see that the person John has the language attribute `:English`, so when you call `say-hello`, he will greet you in English.

Multimethods also allow for a default function, which allows you to call the function even if you are not passing in the expected parameters. Still pretty simple, right?

Stay tuned for more polymorphism in Clojure, and a deeper dive into the Gilded Rose.
