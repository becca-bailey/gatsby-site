Last week, I gave a small talk on the benefits of journaling, and I would like to share some of my thoughts here as well.  

Even when I was a kid, journaling was something that helped me to process my thoughts. And while I’m sure it’s been beneficial for my mental health over the years, the downside to this is that I have in my possession full, annotated documentation of many of my most cringeworthy moments. For that reason, in recent years, I have come to prefer password-protected word documents over Hello Kitty notebooks, but my practice has stayed largely the same. 

## Why do I journal? 

### Reflection

While I often fail at this, I try to write something every day. And by something, I mean a lot of total nonsense. Typically it’s a grammatically-incorrect laundry list of all the things I’m stressed about, or a recollection of a conversation I had, or something good that happened today. 

Journaling also helps us to learn more about ourselves, and to see patterns in our reactions and in our behaviors. Self-knowledge is power—it can help us to better understand our strengths and weaknesses and make better decisions. 

### Goal Setting

I recently had this experience where I read back over some of my journal entries from last year, and came across some goals I had set for this year. Even though there are still things I’m striving for, it gave me a lot of confidence to know that I now met many of my goals. 

Journaling is our written documentation of our hopes, our wishes, and our regrets. By reflecting on the goals you have met and the ones you haven’t, we can get a better idea of where our personal narrative is headed. 

### Practice

When I was a kid, my other favorite thing to do was play the piano. I would like to take this moment to give a shout out to my parents, who listened to me play all the wrong notes over and over again for years before they finally invested in an electronic piano with headphones. But the lesson I have learned from this is that we will never get better at something until we do it badly many times. 

Even though my journal entries are usually jumbled together thoughts that are rarely grammatically correct, I believe the practice of journaling has made me a better writer, and a better overall communicator. 

## Journaling for Professional Improvement

Though we usually think of journaling as a personal activity, Lately, I have been exploring some ways to use it in a professional setting. In any job, it helps to think about questions like: 

+ What went well? What can I do better?
+ What did I get done today? How did it make me feel?
+ What do I want to accomplish next?

From my own experience, keeping a record of what I have accomplished—even if it’s just for me can be a powerful way to combat imposter syndrome.

### Problem Solving

When I researched professional journaling, one of the points that stood out to me was the importance of sequential thought. 

Sometimes, when we encounter a problem, whether it is personal or professional, it’s easy to get get stuck. Sometimes the same thoughts or feelings will play on repeat in our head, holding us back from moving forward. While it’s certainly possible to write down the same thoughts many times, on paper it becomes more obvious that we need to break the cycle and do the next thing. The process of writing can lead us to more sequential thoughts.

## Ideas:

+ If you are a more structured person, make a template with some specific questions to reflect on every day. 

+ If you are a less structured person, try mixing it up. You can try art journaling, or journaling through a book you are reading. 

Journaling can be really good for mental health, as it is one area of our lives where we don’t need to perform for anyone. Our thoughts can be incorrect, repetitive, and unedited, and no one else ever needs to know. The best part about journaling is that it is completely free, you can start anytime, and there are very few disadvantages.
