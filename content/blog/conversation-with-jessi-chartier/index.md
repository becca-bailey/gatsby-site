Recently, I had the pleasure of speaking with Jessi Chartier, who is the camp coordinator from App Camp for Girls in Chicago, which we will be hosting here at the 8th Light office from July 24th to the 28th. When she isn’t planning App Camp, Jessi is the Director of Programs at Uncharted Learning, a not-for-profit that enables students to learn coding and entrepreneurship skills through their two programs—MobileMakersEdu and INCubatorEdu.
